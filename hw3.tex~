%Question #1

\section*{Question 1}

Do problem 10 from section 4.2 of the course reader.\\

{\noindent\bf Answer:}
{
 \newline
Base case: $n=1+1/3+1/5+7/15=1$, and  $1$ is integer\newline
\newline
Inductive step: Choose $k \in Z $ s.t $k^{3}/3+k^{5}/5+7k/15$ is integer\newline
Observe that $(k+1)^{3}/3+(k+1)^{5}/5+7(k+1)/15=$\newline
$= k^{5}/5+k^{4}+7k_{3}/3+3k_{2}+2k +7k/15+1=$\newline
$=k^{5}/5+7(k_{3}/3) +7k/15 +k^{4}+3k_{2}+2k+1=$\newline
$=k^{5}/5+k_{3}/3 +7k/15 +k^{4}+2k_{3}+3k_{2}+2k+1=$\newline
We know that $k^{5}/5+k_{3}/3 +7k/15$ is integer\newline
An we know $k^{4}+2k_{3}+3k_{2}+2k+1$ is also integer because $k \in Z$\newline
Sum of integers is integer\newline
Thus $(k+1)^{3}/3+(k+1)^{5}/5+7(k+1)/15$ is integer$\square$

%Question #2

\section*{Question 2}

Do problem 14 from section 4.2 of the course reader.\\
{
Answer:\newline
 \newline
Base Case: When $n=0,\binom{1\quad 1}{0\quad 1}^0=\binom{1\quad 0}{0\quad 1}=\binom{1\quad 0}{0\quad 1}$ is true, because matrix to the zeroth power is identity matrix of the same dimensions\newline
 \newline
Inductive Step:\newline
Choose $k \in Z$ s.t $\binom{1\quad 1}{0\quad 1}^k=\binom{1\quad k}{0\quad 1}$\newline
Observe that $\binom{1\quad 1}{0\quad 1}^{k+1}=$\newline
$=\binom{1\quad 1}{0\quad 1}^k\binom{1\quad 1}{0\quad 1}=$\newline
$=\binom{1\quad k}{0\quad 1}\binom{1\quad 1}{0\quad 1}=$\newline
$=\binom{1\quad k+1}{0\quad 1}$\newline
Thus we showed $\binom{1\quad 1}{0\quad 1}^{k+1}=\binom{1\quad k+1}{0\quad 1}$ $\square$

%Question #3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Question 3}

Define a sequence of numbers via the following rules:
\begin{align*}
  a_{0}&=0\\
  a_{1}&=1\\
  a_{n+2}&=a_{n+1}+a_{n}
\end{align*}
where $n\geq 0$. This is called the Fibonacci sequence.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Question #3: Part a
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Part a}

Use induction to show that $a_{n}\leq 2^{n}$ for $n\geq 0$.\newline

{\noindent\bf Answer:}
{
 \newline
Base Case: $a_{2}=1+0 $ $a_{2}=1 \leq 2^{2}=4$ is true\newline
Induction Hypothesis: Let $n>2,2 \leq i<n, a_{i} \a_{i} \leq 2^{i}$ So if we know that $a_{i} \leq 2^{i}$ then $a_{i-1}+a_{i-2} \leq 2^{i-1}+2^{i-2}$\newline
Inductive step:\newline
By strong induction, choose $k$ s.t  $a_{k}\leq 2^{k}$ for $k \geq 0$\newline
Observe that $a_{k+1}= a_{k} + a_{k-1}< 2^{k}+2^{k-1}$\newline
So $2^{k}+2^{k-1} < 2^{k}+2^{k}$\newline
We prove that statement is true for any k$\square$
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Question #3: Part b
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Part b}

Use induction to show that $a_{3n}\in\mathbb{E}$ for $n\geq 0$.\newline

{\noindent\bf Answer:}
{
 \newline
Base Case: $n=1$, $a_{3}\in\mathbb{E}$ because $a_{3}=a_{2}+a_{1}=2$ it is true\newline
Inductive Step: Choose $k \in Z$ s.t $a_{3k}\in\mathbb{E}$\newline
Observe that $a_{3(k+1)}=a_{3k+1}+a_{3k+2}=$\newline
$=a_{3k-1}+a_{3k}+a_{3k}+a_{3k+1}=$\newline
$=a_{3k-1}+2a_{3k}+a_{3k-1}+a_{3k}=$\newline
$=2a_{3k-1}+2a_{3k}$\newline
We see that $a_{3(k+1)}=2(a_{3k-1}+a_{3k})$
Then $a_{3(k+1)}$ is even\newline
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Question #3: Part c
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Part c}

Use induction to show that $a_{3n+1}\in\mathbb{O}$ for $n\geq 0$.\newline

{\noindent\bf Answer:}
{
 \newline
Base case: n=1, $a_{4}=a_{3}+a_{2}=2+1=3$ 3 is in O\newline
Inductive Step: Choose $k \in Z$ s.t $a_{3k+1}\in\mathbb{O}$\newline
Observe that $a_{3(k+1)+1}=a_{3(k+1)}+a_{3k+2}=$\newline
$=a_{3k+3}+a_{3k+2}=a_{3k+1}+a_{3k+2}+a_{3k}+a_{3k+1}=$\newline
$=2a_{3k+1}+a_{3k+1}+a_{3k}+a_{3k}=3a_{3k+1}+2a_{3k}$\newline
We can see that $a_{3(k+1)+1} \in O$

}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Question #3: Part d
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Part d}

Use parts b) and c) to show that $a_{3n+2}\in\mathbb{O}$ for $n\geq 0$.\newline
{\noindent\bf Answer:}
{
Proof: From part a and part b we know that $a_{3n+1}\in\mathbb{O}$ and $a_{3n}\in\mathbb{E}$\newline
Observe that $a_{3n+2}= a_{3n+1}+a_{3n}$\newline
Sum of odd and even number is always odd\newline

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Question #4: Part c
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Part c}

Why can't you use induction in the previous parts?\\

{\noindent\bf Answer:}
{
 \newline
Induction only guarantees that P(n) is true for all n in N , and infinity is not included in it.
The unions above might be uncountable\newline

%Question #5
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Question 5}

Do problem 8 from section 3.2 of the course reader.\\

{\noindent\bf Answer:}
{
 \newline
$C(Z*Z)=C(Z)=\eta$\newline
Example: function $f(x,y)=((x+y)(x+y+1))/2+y, x+y=n$\newline
This function is one to one\newline
Proof:\newline
A function $f:Z*Z \rightarrow Z*Z$ is 1:1 when $f(a,b)=f(c,d)$ where $a=c,b=d$\newline
Observe that $\binom{x+y+1}{2} \leq f(x,y) \leq \binom{x+y+2}{2}$\newline
$f(x_{1},y_{1}) \neq f(x_{2},y_{2})$for $x_{1}+y_{1} \neq x_{2}+y_{2}$\newline
$x_{1}+y_{1} = x_{2}+y_{2}$ with $y_{1} \neq y_{2}$ then\newline
$f(x_{1},y_{1})-f(x_{2},y_{2})=y_{1} - y_{2} \neq 0$\newline
Thus the function is 1:1
